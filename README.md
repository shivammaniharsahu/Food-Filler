SERVICE TO MANKIND IS SERVICE TO GOD!! DON'T WASTE WHAT IS EDIBLE, DONATE!

An initiative for the the people who need food and can't afford it. We provide a plateform for the people who want to donate leftover food so that these food can reach to needy person and we can stop food wastage. Food donation is the utmost service of love and care you can show for the poor and needy. Our idea here is to present an web portal for online food donation where you can donate food without any hassle or issues. 

The website serves the functionality at two ends- at the end of the user, the user can donate, gain points and also look at what he has donated and has it reached the people required. On the other end, the NGOs can register themselves on our portal and can collect food from users and can serve the mankind as they already are doing. This is one of the first web portal where in everyone can track, donate and also get rewarded based on donations. The user will be able to get the NGO working nearby them, so they can be contacted for any issues.

We are currently working as a team Food-Filler and try to help community so that no one sleep empty stomach.
